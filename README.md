# CompareArrays
Function for finding matches in given arrays with generics. Repeats in the incoming data array are eliminated through the use of HashSet.
Due to the intricacies of using Map, it was possible to reduce the time complexity to O(n), when the typed search by the cycle-in-cycle technique takes O(n^2).
